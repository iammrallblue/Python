What to Learn

    Variables: Store values with names (e.g., price = 100).

    Basic Operations: Addition (+), multiplication (*), etc.
'''

# price = 50
price = 100
# quantity = 3
quantity = 4
total = price * quantity
print("Total price is:", total)

# quantity = 3 => 100 * 3 = 300
# quantity = 4 => 100 * 4 = 400

'''
Why It Works:

    price = 50: Stores 50 in a variable (a “box” named price).

    quantity = 3: Another “box” with 3.

    total = price * quantity: Multiplies the values (50 * 3 = 150) and stores in total.

    print(...): Shows the result with a label.
