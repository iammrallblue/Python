Part 1: Loops (for and while)
Why: Loops repeat actions—like listing items in a cart or calculating totals for many products.

Explanation
for Loop: Repeats over a sequence (e.g., numbers, items).  
Syntax: for variable in sequence:
Example: for i in range(3): print(i) → 0, 1, 2.
while Loop: Repeats until a condition is false.  
Syntax: while condition:
Example: count = 0; while count < 3: print(count); count += 1 → 0, 1, 2.
